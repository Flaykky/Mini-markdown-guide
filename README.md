## 1. Headings

Headings organize your content into sections. Use the hash symbol (`#`) followed by a space to create them. The number of hashes sets the heading level, from `#` (largest) to `######` (smallest).

```markdown
# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section
### H3 - Subsection
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6 - Tiny Heading
```

**Example Output:**  
# H1 - Main Title  
## H2 - Section  
### H3 - Subsection  

**Tip:** Use H1 for your document‚Äôs title and H2-H6 for structuring sections and subtopics.

---

## 2. Emphasis

Make your text stand out with emphasis:  

- **Bold**: Wrap text in double asterisks `**bold**` or underscores `__bold__`.  
- *Italic*: Use single asterisks `*italic*` or underscores `_italic_`.  
- ***Bold & Italic***: Combine with triple asterisks `***bold italic***` or underscores `___bold italic___`.  
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use double tildes `~~strikethrough~~`.  

```markdown
This has **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, and ~~strikethrough~~ text.
```

**Example Output:**  
This has **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, and ~~strikethrough~~ text.

**Tip:** Use emphasis sparingly to highlight key points without overwhelming the reader.

## 3. Lists

Lists help you present information clearly. Markdown supports unordered and ordered lists.

### Unordered Lists

Start items with `-`, `*`, or `+` followed by a space:  

```markdown
- Apple
- Banana
  - Yellow
  - Sweet
* Orange
+ Grape
```

**Example Output:**  
- Apple  
- Banana  
  - Yellow  
  - Sweet  
* Orange  
+ Grape  

**Tip:** Nest items by indenting with two spaces.

### Ordered Lists

Use numbers followed by a dot and a space:  

```markdown
1. Step one
2. Step two
   1. Substep 2.1
   2. Substep 2.2
3. Step three
```

**Example Output:**  
1. Step one  
2. Step two  
   1. Substep 2.1  
   2. Substep 2.2  
3. Step three  

**Note:** Numbers don‚Äôt need to be sequential; Markdown auto-corrects them.

---

## 4. Links and Images

### Links

Add clickable links with this format: `[text](URL "optional title")`.  

```markdown
[Google](https://google.com "Search Engine")
```

**Example Output:**  
[Google](https://google.com "Search Engine")  

### Images

Embed images using an exclamation mark `!`, alt text, and a URL:  

```markdown
![Cute Cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg "A fluffy kitten")
```

**Tip:** Alt text improves accessibility by describing the image if it doesn‚Äôt load.

---

## 5. Code

Show off code snippets with proper formatting.

### Inline Code

Wrap short code in single backticks:  

```markdown
Use `print("Hello")` to display text.
```

**Example Output:**  
Use `print("Hello")` to display text.

### Code Blocks

For larger code, use triple backticks (```) or indent with four spaces. Add a language name for syntax highlighting:  

```markdown
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```
```

**Example Output:**  
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

**Tip:** Common languages include `python`, `javascript`, `html`, and `css`.

---

## 6. Blockquotes

Quote text or add notes with a `>` at the start of each line:  

```markdown
> Markdown is awesome!
>
> It‚Äôs simple and versatile.
```

**Example Output:**  
> Markdown is awesome!  
>  
> It‚Äôs simple and versatile.  

**Tip:** Use blockquotes for quotes, asides, or to emphasize important notes.

---

## 7. Horizontal Rules

Separate sections with a horizontal line using three or more `-`, `*`, or `_`:  

```markdown
---
```

**Example Output:**  
---

**Tip:** Great for breaking up long documents into readable chunks.

---

## 8. Tables

Organize data with tables using pipes `|` and hyphens `-`:  

```markdown
| Name     | Age | City    |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Alice    | 25  | London  |
| Bob      | 30  | New York|
```

**Example Output:**  
| Name     | Age | City    |  
|----------|-----|---------|  
| Alice    | 25  | London  |  
| Bob      | 30  | New York|  

**Tip:** Add colons to align text: `|:---|` (left), `|---:|` (right), `|:---:|` (center).

---

## 9. Inline HTML

For extra formatting, use raw HTML directly in your Markdown:  

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click me!</summary>
Surprise! Hidden text here.
</details>
```

**Example Output:**  
<details>  
<summary>Click me!</summary>  
Surprise! Hidden text here.  
</details>  

**Note:** Keep HTML minimal to preserve Markdown‚Äôs simplicity.

## 10. Tips & Tricks

Level up your Markdown with these handy tips:  

- **Auto-numbered Lists:** Markdown fixes numbering for you:  
  ```markdown
  1. One
  1. Two
  1. Three
  ```  
  Becomes:  
  1. One  
  2. Two  
  3. Three  

- **Reference-style Links:** Cleaner links with references:  
  ```markdown
  [GitHub][1] is great!  
  [1]: https://github.com "Code Hosting"
  ```

- **Escaping Characters:** Use `\` to show special characters literally:  
  ```markdown
  \*Not italic\* and \#Not a heading\#
  ```  
  Output:  
  *Not italic* and #Not a heading#  

- **Line Breaks:** Add two spaces at the end of a line for a new line without a new paragraph.  

- **Task Lists:** Some platforms support checkboxes:  
  ```markdown
  - [x] Done
  - [ ] To do
  ```

- **Emojis:** Add flair with `:emoji-name:` (e.g., `:smile:` = üòä) on supported platforms.

## How to write documentation right?

## 1. Start with a Clear Title
- Use a single `#` for the main title to clearly define the document‚Äôs purpose.
- Keep it concise and descriptive.
  ```markdown
  # Project Documentation
  ```

## 2. Include a Table of Contents
- For longer documents, add a clickable table of contents (TOC) linking to sections.
- Use relative links to headings (e.g., `[Section](#section-name)`).
  ```markdown
  ## Table of Contents
  - [Introduction](#introduction)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  ```

## 3. Organize with Headings
- Use heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) logically to create a hierarchy.
- Avoid skipping levels (e.g., don‚Äôt jump from `##` to `####`).
- Keep headings short and specific.
  ```markdown
  ## Installation
  ### Prerequisites
  ### Steps
  ```

## 4. Write Clear and Concise Text
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) for readability.
- Avoid jargon unless defined; include a glossary if needed.
- Use active voice and present tense where possible.
  ```markdown
  This tool helps you analyze data quickly. Follow these steps to get started.
  ```

## 5. Use Lists for Steps and Items
- Use **unordered lists** (`-` or `*`) for non-sequential items.
- Use **ordered lists** (`1.`, `2.`) for step-by-step instructions.
- Indent sub-items with two spaces for clarity.
  ```markdown
  ### Installation Steps
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies:
     - Run `npm install`.
     - Check for updates.
  ```

## 6. Format Code Properly
- Use **inline code** (`` `code` ``) for short snippets like commands or variables.
- Use **code blocks** (triple backticks ```) for longer examples, specifying the language for syntax highlighting.
  ```markdown
  Run this command: `npm start`

  ```python
  def example():
      print("Hello, Markdown!")
  ```
  ```

## 7. Include Links and Images
- Use descriptive link text and include titles for accessibility.
- For images, provide meaningful alt text and store images in a dedicated folder (e.g., `/images/`).
  ```markdown
  [Project Repo](https://github.com/user/repo "GitHub Repository")
  ![Screenshot](/images/app-screenshot.png "App Interface")
  ```

## 8. Use Tables for Structured Data
- Align columns clearly using `|`, and use hyphens `-` for headers.
- Add colons for alignment: `|:---|` (left), `|---:|` (right), `|:---:|` (center).
  ```markdown
  | Feature | Description       | Status  |
  |:--------|:------------------|:-------:|
  | Login   | User auth         | Done    |
  | Search  | Full-text search  | In Progress |
  ```

## 9. Add Blockquotes for Notes or Warnings
- Use `>` for notes, warnings, or important callouts.
- Keep them short and distinct from main content.
  ```markdown
  > **Note:** Ensure you have Node.js v16 or higher installed.
  ```

## 10. Use Horizontal Rules Sparingly
- Use `---` to separate major sections, but avoid overuse to maintain flow.
  ```markdown
  ## Section One
  Content here.
  ---
  ## Section Two
  ```

## 11. Leverage Inline HTML for Advanced Needs
- Use HTML for features not supported by standard Markdown, like collapsible sections.
- Keep it minimal to maintain Markdown‚Äôs simplicity.
  ```markdown
  <details>
  <summary>Advanced Settings</summary>
  Configure optional parameters here.
  </details>
  ```

## 12. Follow Naming and Linking Conventions
- Use lowercase and hyphens for file names (e.g., `user-guide.md`).
- Use relative paths for internal links (e.g., `[Setup](./setup.md)`).
- Include a `LICENSE` file or link for licensing details.
  ```markdown
  See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
  ```

## 13. Enhance with Tips and Best Practices
- Add a ‚ÄúTips‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest Practices‚Äù section for common pitfalls or shortcuts.
- Use task lists (`- [ ]`) or emojis (`:warning:`) for emphasis if supported.
  ```markdown
  ### Tips
  - [x] Test commands locally before documenting.
  - [ ] Use `:warning:` for critical notes.
  ```

## 14. Keep Accessibility in Mind
- Use descriptive alt text for images.
- Ensure links are meaningful (avoid ‚Äúclick here‚Äù).
- Structure content logically for screen readers.

## 15. Test and Preview
- Preview your Markdown in a renderer (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, or a static site generator).
- Check for formatting errors, broken links, or rendering issues.
- Use tools like CommonMark-compliant parsers for consistency.

## 16. Maintain Consistency
- Use a style guide for consistent formatting (e.g., spaces, list markers).
- Document one topic per file for large projects, linking them via a TOC.
- Update documentation as the project evolves.


By following these practices, your Markdown documentation will be clear, organized, and user-friendly. For advanced features, refer to the [CommonMark Spec](https://commonmark.org/) or your platform‚Äôs Markdown guide.
